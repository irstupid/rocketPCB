my submission to the hackclub solder thing
hi, im ian. i made a little rocket ship keychain, and when you press the button it will slowly charge up using capacitors. it uses 3 capacitors, wich is more than is allowed, but i have my own capacitors that i intend to use. so with that, the bill of components is:
3x 220Ω resisitors
3x 4.7kΩ resistors
3x 5mm LED (preferebly red, yellow, and green :))
3x NPN transistors
1x battery holder
capacitors are already supplied

this is the view of the schematic:

this is the view of the PCB routes and stuff:
